# Task-5-Traffic-Accident-Data-Analysis
In this project, traffic accident data was analyzed to identify patterns and contributing factors related to weather conditions, lighting environments, time of day, and geographical distribution.

The dataset was composed of detailed records containing information such as accident severity, timing, location, weather conditions, and lighting status. Python tools like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib were utilized to preprocess the data and generate meaningful visualizations.

## Key Goals:
1. Identify high-risk conditions (e.g., poor lighting or bad weather).
2. Detect temporal patterns (accidents by hour or weekday).
3. Visualize state-wise accident distribution.
4. Lay the foundation for possible accident hotspot mapping.
